        I have a Scala program that generates Verilog. I made modifications to the Verilog code and now need to update the corresponding Chisel code.

        The fixed Verilog represents the desired changes. Here is the unified diff between the original and fixed Verilog:
        ```
        {verilog_diff}
        ```
        The unified diff you provided refers to lines not present in the current Chisel source, here is the buggy chisel diff:
        ```
        {generate_diff}
        ```
        When applying this diff, the applier generates the following error:
        ```
        {applier_error}
        ```
        Additionally, based on further code analysis, here are new hints extracted from the chisel_original with hints "->" marking the lines that are most likely to require changes:
        ```
        {new_hints}
        ```
        Please provide a unified diff that implements all necessary updates to the Chisel code and please generate a new unified diff that only modifies existing lines.
        Output *only* the diff in unified diff format with only the minimal hunk containing the changed lines and no additional commentary or headers or Note.
        PLEASE No explanation, no Note. ONLY diff

        Can you give me a Chisel diff that could work? 
        Output *only* the diff in **unified diff format** with only the minimal hunk containing the changed lines and no additional commentary or headers or Note.
        PLEASE No explanation, no Note. ONLY diff, **unified diff format**
