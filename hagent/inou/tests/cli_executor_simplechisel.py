"""
Simple test example using Runner for SimpleChisel functionality.
Demonstrates simplified command execution with unified API.
Converted to use Runner instead of direct Executor/ContainerManager/PathManager usage.

Can be run as:
1. CLI tool: uv run python hagent/inou/tests/cli_executor_simplechisel.py
2. Slow test: uv run pytest -m slow hagent/inou/tests/cli_executor_simplechisel.py
