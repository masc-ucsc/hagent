An AI hardware agent engine that supports multiple components in chip design, including code generation, verification, debugging, and tapeout.

HAgent is an open-source infrastructure that brings the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to hardware design. By integrating LLMs with chip design tools in a compiler-inspired pipeline, HAgent enables the creation of custom EDA flows. Its architecture leverages hermetic Docker-based steps and YAML interfaces to simplify development, debugging, and testing, making it accessible and extensible for researchers and practitioners.

## Installation and Setup

For complete installation and setup instructions, including prerequisites, API keys, and synthesis tools, please see [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

## MCP Quick Start

Check the [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for simple examples on how to interface HAgent as a MCP server.

## Pass Quick Start

After installation, run a simple test to verify everything works:

```bash
# Run basic tests
uv run pytest hagent/step/trivial/tests/

# Run a simple trivial step (Docker mode - recommended)
export HAGENT_DOCKER=mascucsc/hagent-simplechisel:2025.10
mkdir -p tmp && cd tmp
uv run ../hagent/step/trivial/trivial.py ../hagent/step/trivial/tests/input1.yaml -o output.yaml
cat output.yaml

# Alternative: Run in local mode (don't set HAGENT_DOCKER)
unset HAGENT_DOCKER
export HAGENT_REPO_DIR=$(pwd)
export HAGENT_BUILD_DIR=$(pwd)/build
export HAGENT_CACHE_DIR=$(pwd)/cache
# Same command works in both modes!
uv run ../hagent/step/trivial/trivial.py ../hagent/step/trivial/tests/input1.yaml -o output.yaml
```
